# hello-world
This is my first project on GitHub. This is a first step. And this is a big step for myself.
I'm a student in the third year of university at this moment. My name is Kureox. Strange, right? I think that words and behaviour are things which can be materials when others judge you. Name has to be the last.
I have learned little about C, C++, Python, Html5. I want to be a better programmer by do something on GitHub. Let's get better.

#commit message
This is a try for a new function, which is brand-new for each of us. I'd like to make greate changes during developing this repository. So let's go!
